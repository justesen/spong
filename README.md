spong - simple Pong
===================
spong is a simple Pong clone.


1) Installation
---------------
No installation is necessary, just untar where you want it installed
and run it.

Note that this program uses Python3, which is not default on most
platforms. So check whether you need to run it with python or 
Python3.

However easy that may be, you'll need pygame. You can probably get it
from your distros repository (unix) or download it from 
`http://pygame.org` (unix/windows). However pygame is not yet ready for
Python3, so you might have to substitute `raw_input` for `input` in
config.py and setup.py before installing (from source that is).


2) Running
----------
`$ python spong.py [options]`
